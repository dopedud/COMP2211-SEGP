SEG first meeting (02/02/2023)

brian didn't attend

discuss on which topic to choose

first project seems more interesting, more fun, but will end up doing more work

second project seems more mundane, dealing more with data than calculation, but may end up less work

overall, both would seem that both of them requires approximately the same work

need to split the team to backend and frontend, to avoid confusion and emphasise project structure

agreed to use gitlab soton to manage version control of our project

first project seems there's more work in frontend compared to second project

geeth suggest that the second project's frontend work seems deceptive

agreed on doing the first project
